## 🏠 What is Smart Garage?

Smart Garage manages **impulse-based garage doors** — the kind where a single relay press cycles through:

> **Open → Stop → Close → Stop → Open → …**

Unlike simple on/off switches, Smart Garage uses a **pulse-counting state machine** that knows exactly where your door is — even after a Home Assistant restart, even when operated by a physical button, even when stopped mid-travel.

Designed for **Homematic IP** hardware but works with **any impulse-driven garage door motor** that has a Home Assistant switch or button entity.

## 📋 Requirements

| Component | Required? | Purpose |
|:----------|:---------:|:--------|
| **Switch or Button entity** | ✅ Required | Triggers the garage door motor (e.g. HmIP-PCBS) |
| Limit switch — bottom | ⭐ Recommended | Confirms closed position (e.g. HmIP-FCI6 ch1) |
| Limit switch — top | ⭐ Recommended | Confirms open position (e.g. HmIP-FCI6 ch2) |
| Vibration / tilt sensor | 💡 Optional | Detects door movement + enables safety (e.g. HmIP-STV) |
| External button entity | 💡 Optional | Detects physical button presses |
| Temperature + humidity — indoor | 💡 Optional | Enables ventilation control |
| Temperature + humidity — outdoor | 💡 Optional | Enables ventilation control |
| Rain sensor | 💡 Optional | Enables rain auto-close |
| Presence entity | 💡 Optional | Ventilation only when someone is home |
| Notification service | 💡 Optional | Push notifications for safety events |

> 💡 **Graceful degradation**: The integration works with just a control switch. Each optional sensor adds capabilities. Without climate sensors → no ventilation. Without rain sensor → no rain auto-close. The entities for disabled features are simply not created.

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Impulse Motor Cycle

```
From CLOSED:
  Pulse 1 → OPENING    Pulse 2 → STOPPED
  Pulse 3 → CLOSING    Pulse 4 → STOPPED
  Pulse 5 → OPENING    (cycle repeats)

From OPEN:
  Pulse 1 → CLOSING    Pulse 2 → STOPPED
  Pulse 3 → OPENING    Pulse 4 → STOPPED
  Pulse 5 → CLOSING    (cycle repeats)
```

### Pulse Counting State Machine

The integration tracks two values:
- **Sync state** — last confirmed position from a limit switch (`CLOSED` or `OPEN`)
- **Pulse count** — number of pulses since the last sync

The current door state is derived as: **`sync_state + (pulse_count - 1) mod 4`**

When a limit switch fires → pulse counter resets to 0 (new sync point).

### Position Estimation

During movement: `position = elapsed_time ÷ travel_time × 100%`

Position is estimated relative to a **baseline captured at the start of each movement**, not always from 0% or 100%. This matters for repeated stop/reverse cycles: opening, stopping, then opening again continues accurately from the last known position instead of resetting the estimate to a full 0–100% traversal.

When limit switches are configured, the integration **never** assumes the door reached its end position based on time alone — it waits for sensor confirmation.

### Multi-Pulse Commands

| From → To | Pulses needed | Sequence |
|:----------|:-------------:|:---------|
| Closed → Opening | 1 | Open |
| Opening → Stopped | 1 | Stop |
| Stopped (up) → Closing | 1 | Close |
| Stopped (up) → Opening | 3 | Close → Stop → Open |
| Stopped (down) → Closing | 3 | Open → Stop → Close |
| Closing → Opening | 2 | Stop → Open |

All multi-pulse sequences always run to completion once started — see [Command Serialization](#command-serialization) below for how overlapping commands are handled.

### Command Serialization

Issuing a new command while a previous multi-pulse sequence (e.g. a close→stop→open reversal) is still in progress used to be able to send pulses from two overlapping commands at the same time, desyncing the pulse counter from the real door position. Every command now runs under an exclusive lock:

1. A new command waits for any in-progress command to finish completely before starting.
2. Multi-pulse sequences always run to completion undisturbed — they are never interrupted mid-sequence.
3. Once the previous command has fully finished, the new command starts and acts on the door's actual resulting state.

This guarantees pulses from two commands can never interleave. The trade-off is a small delay (at most a couple of pulse-delay intervals, typically well under 2 seconds) if a new command is issued while a multi-pulse sequence is still running — a safer and far more predictable behavior than trying to interrupt pulses mid-flight.

You can watch the **Pulse Count** diagnostic sensor to see this in action: it increments with each pulse sent and resets to 0 the moment a limit switch confirms the door is fully closed or fully open, letting you verify the pulse-counting state machine matches the real door position at any time.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Entity IDs show wrong language</b></summary>

Entity IDs are generated once when entities are first created. If they have German names from a previous version, delete the integration and re-add it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Homematic actor loses connection</b></summary>

Increase the **Pulse delay** setting. Homematic IP devices can lose connectivity when receiving too many RF signals in quick succession. Default is 1 second; try 2-3 seconds.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Wrong state after HA restart</b></summary>

The state is persisted via RestoreEntity. If incorrect, operate the door once so a limit switch fires and triggers a sync (resets pulse counter to 0).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Stop doesn't respond quickly</b></summary>

Fixed in v1.0: service calls use fire-and-forget (no `blocking=True`), so the stop command is processed immediately without waiting for Homematic RF confirmation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Position becomes inaccurate after repeated stop/reverse cycles</b></summary>

Fixed in v1.0.3: position is now calculated relative to a baseline captured at the start of each movement, instead of always assuming travel from 0% or 100%. Update to the latest version if you still see this.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>False "accidental opening" warning when I open the door myself</b></summary>

Fixed in v1.0.3: the safety warning no longer fires for an explicit open command (UI, service call, or physical button), even from a ventilating state. It now correctly fires only when the door overshoots past the ventilation gap after an automatic or manual ventilation trigger, without an explicit open command.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Door doesn't respond correctly (or moves the wrong way) after rapid Open/Stop/Open clicks</b></summary>

Fixed in v1.0.4: commands are now fully serialized by simply waiting for any in-progress multi-pulse sequence to finish completely, instead of interrupting it. An earlier interrupt-based approach (v1.0.3) could itself cause a sequence to abort after only 1 of 3 pulses if two commands overlapped, leaving the door stuck. Update to the latest version if you still see this. Watch the **Pulse Count** diagnostic sensor to verify the internal counter matches physical door movement.

Go to the device page → ⋮ → **Download diagnostics**. This creates a JSON file with the complete state machine state, sensor states, and configuration (sensitive data redacted).
